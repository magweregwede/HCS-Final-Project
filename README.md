# HCS-Final-Project

## DESIGN OF A WEB-BASED REAL-TIME DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYTICS PLATFORM

This capstone project focuses on designing a web-based real-time logistics data management and analytics platform for Schweppes Zimbabwe Limited (SZL). This will replace the current inefficient, error-prone manual logistic management with a centralized automated platform. The system allows for real-time data logging, analytics, and visualization that shall be useful to distribution clerks, managers, and executives in decision-making. The transport logging, role-based access control, predictive analytics, and automated reporting will be integrated into the platform using an incremental development methodology. The platformâ€™s design integrates modern technologies and data visualization tools to ensure scalability, security and usability
